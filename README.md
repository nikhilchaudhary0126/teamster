# Teamster

Teamster is the best way to track the workflow and manage the time of focus, break, habit, and meetings on top of the project management service and increasing the productivity of projects and maintaining the work-life balance of the working employee.

## What it does

Teamster solves problems by allowing tasks associated with project management service and makes tracking time easier as the users are provided with timers in the Pomodoro technique. It also keeps the track of different user activities such as focus, break, habit, meetings and also manages board of messages from workforce in a fun and unique way.

## How we built

**ReactJS** was used the frontend framework to create the application with a **REST API** setup using **Flask** as the server. We employ API calls to perform standard CRUD operations for user and team management. We use **MySQL** server as the database for our applications which is hosted using **AWS RDS** accessed using `PyMySQL` for connection.
